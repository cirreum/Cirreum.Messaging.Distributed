/// Conductor would re-trigger that outbound interceptor — re-publishing the received
/// message back to the bus in an infinite loop.
/// <see cref="DistributedMessageReceived{TMessage}"/> is a distinct notification shape
/// that the outbound interceptor does not catch, so inbound dispatch flows to app handlers
/// without re-entering the send path.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The wrapper carries both the deserialized typed message and the original envelope
/// so handlers can inspect wire-level metadata (producer id, message identifier, version,
/// publish timestamp) without re-deserializing or threading additional context state.
